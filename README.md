# BigDataProjectDIT
Data Visualization Project using Python and other tools

| Deliverable | Due date | Details | Grading |
|-------------|----------|---------|---------|
| Presentation | 11th April 2019 (during Wednesday lecture)| Each team to prepare a ten-minute presentation. Time limits will be strictly adhered to. | 20/100 |
| Group Report |  Sunday 31 March 2019 23:55 | (pdf format), presentation contents, and artefact submitted to Moodle in a zipped folder. Each team member to submit a 1000-1400 report summarizing the visualization exercise and learning experience in a zipped folder together with the group presentation and related workbooks. | 50/100 |
| Individual lessons learned report | Sunday 31 March 2019 23:55 | together with report |30/100 |

The Project is worth 30% of the overall module mark. 

### Open data source selected: 
Aviation crashes dataset
#### Database Format
| Column Name | Summary |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Date:         | Date of accident,  in the format - January 01, 2001 |
| Time:         | Local time, in 24 hr. format unless otherwise specified |
| Airline/Op:   | Airline or operator of the aircraft |
| Flight #:     | Flight number assigned by the aircraft operator |
| Route:        | Complete or partial route flown prior to the accident |
| AC Type:      | Aircraft type |
| Reg:          | ICAO registration of the aircraft |
| cn / ln:      | Construction or serial number / Line or fuselage number |
| Aboard:	    | Total aboard (passengers / crew) |
| Fatalities:	| Total fatalities aboard (passengers / crew) |
| Ground:	    | Total killed on the ground |
| Summary:	    | Brief description of the accident and cause if known |

### Questions to be answered: 

* Fatalities before and after hitting the ground
* Text analysis: find causes in description text
* (Advanced) Text analysis - sentiment analysis
* Where do most planes crash (by time period)? Heat map with locations - period of 5-10 years? - change over time - animation/several time periods?
* Separate into sections? Location by continent, night/day flight, type of aircraft etc



### Assignment

* Tools and/or programming languages may be applied.
* Apply Data Visualisation Tools and Techniques to extract insights from the data in support of your questions.
* Teams to work together in discussing and producing a combined group project artefact. 
* Each team member to submit a 1000-1400 report (pdf format) summarizing the visualization exercise and learning experience in a zipped folder together with the group presentation and related workbooks.
