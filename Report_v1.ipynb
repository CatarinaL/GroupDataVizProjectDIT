    "\n",
    "The original dataset wasn't used as is, as we had to change some of its structure and contents in order to prepare it for the kind of analysis we had proposed ourselves to perform. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data cleaning** involved mainly putting the location names into a consistent format, by removing text such as \"near to\", or typing errors like \"AtlantiCity\".\n",
    "TODO: times\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additions** Two columns for GPS coordinates, Latitude and Longitude. This was done using the geopy library (explain further in another section...) to scrap data from BingMaps. The script used can be found [here](add_coordinates.py).\n",
    "TODO: complete missing descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deletions** The columns *Flight #*, *Route*, *Registration*, *cn/In* were dropped as we didn't require them for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "[This is the dataset](dataset/clean_v1_Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908.csv) with the actual data we used, after cleaning and completing the original source.\n",

    "### Questions to be answered: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Descriptive:**\n",
    "* Fatalities before and after hitting the ground\n",
    "* Where do most planes crash (by time period)? Heat map with locations - period of 5-10 years? - change over time - animation/several time periods (WW2)?\n",
    "* Separate into sections? Location by continent, night/day flight, type of aircraft etc\n",
    "* Is there a specific make/model that appears more frequently than others\n",
    "* Are they mainly passenger airplanes/cargo airplanes\n",
    "* Does the age of the plane matter,ie, an older/newer plane regarding crashes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predictive:**\n",
    "* When/where should we expect the next crash to happen? With how many fatalities?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text analysis:**\n",
    "* Text analysis: find causes in description text\n",
    "* (Advanced) Text analysis - sentiment analysis\n"
